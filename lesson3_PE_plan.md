Construct a prompt that guides an LLM to craft a comprehensive plan for a software development team transitioning to remote work permanently. The aim is to ensure the prompt elicits detailed strategies covering communication, project management, team collaboration, and maintaining company culture in a remote environment. Include a well-structured example to showcase the format and depth of the desired output based on all you've learned so far.

**Project Management:**

2. Foster collaboration through shared document repositories like Google Drive or Dropbox, enabling team members to access and collaborate on documents in real-time.
3. Encourage peer code reviews and pair programming sessions using tools like GitHub or Bitbucket to maintain code quality and ensure knowledge sharing within the team.
4. Create a knowledge-sharing platform or wiki using tools like Confluence or Notion to document important processes and best practices for team reference.

**Maintaining Company Culture:**
1. Establish remote-friendly cultural norms and values, such as setting expectations for timely responses, respecting work-life boundaries, and promoting inclusivity in virtual meetings.
2. Plan virtual team-building events, such as themed dress-up days, virtual coffee breaks, or book clubs, to maintain a sense of community and connection among team members.
3. Celebrate team achievements and milestones through virtual recognition ceremonies, shout-outs in team channels, or sending personalized gifts to team members' homes.
4. Support employee well-being by offering virtual wellness programs, mental health resources, or flexible work arrangements to ensure a healthy work-life balance for remote employees.
