Remember that you don't want to have too many sections not to confuse your LLM, but some sections are absolutely key to good prompts. And a section called "EXAMPLE" is one of the most important sections you could have.

Restructure this prompt to have the following sections: ASK, CONTEXT, CONSTRAINTS, and EXAMPLE.


__ASK__
Write a five-line child-friendly poem

__CONTEXT__
- I am writing a thrilling story about a unique space corgi that travels through the universe helping strange beings learn new skills. 
- The space corgi, whose name is Cosmo, has just landed on a far-off planet where all the aliens are eager to understand the nuances of prompt engineering. 
- The protagonist is an astronaut.

__CONSTRAINTS__

- five-line only
- about Cosmo that ends with a funny twist involving a comet. 
- it could be something like this example but don't make it exactly this.

__EXAMPLE__

Cosmo the space corgi, so brave and so bright,  
Traveled the stars from morning till night.  
Teaching aliens about prompts, oh what a sight,  
Until a comet passed by, with a tail so tight.  
Cosmo barked, "Chase it?" and took off in flight!
