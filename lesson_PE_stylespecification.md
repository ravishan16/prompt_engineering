Imagine style specification as the process of giving instructions to a highly skilled chef. As you would specify your wish for your steak's doneness, you can guide LLMs in producing the "flavor" of text you desire. The style can encompass various elements, including tone (formal, informal), language (simple, technical), and length (brief, detailed), among others.
